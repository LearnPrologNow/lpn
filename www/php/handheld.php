  We are pleased to announce that Learn Prolog Now! is now available
  in book form: on 15 June 2006 it was published by 
  <a href="http://www.collegepublications.co.uk/">College
  Publications</a> as Volume 7 of their Texts in Computer Science series.
  </p>

  <p>
  Learn Prolog Now has been available as a web-book since 2001.  Over
  this period we have received numerous requests for a real
  hold-in-your-hands version of LPN! (that is, what is technically
  known as a &lsquo;book&rsquo;!). Well, we've finally produced such a thing, but
  we've done more than that.  While preparing it, we took the
  opportunity to make extensive changes and improvements. The most
  important are the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
   We have rewritten a number of crucial sections. In particular, we
   have lengthened and improved our discussion of unification, proof
   search, recursion, termination, and DCGs.
   </li>     
   <li>     
   We have made numerous small corrections and changes throughout
   the text (thanks to the many readers who pointed out errors and
   infelicities).
   </li>
   <li>
   We took the opportunity to get rid of non-ISO constructs
   used in the web-book.
   </li>
   <li>
   We added a Preface (telling a little about the history of LPN!)
   and an introduction (which discusses Prolog from a more general
   perspective). We also added an appendix briefly discussing some
   other books on Prolog that we liked.
   </li>
   <li>
   We added new exercises, worked them all, and put all the answers
   into an appendix.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  So, there you have it: LPN!, the handheld version.
