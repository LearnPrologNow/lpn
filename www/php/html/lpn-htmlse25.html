</a> Reversing a List 
</h3> 
<!--l. 357--> 
<p class="noindent"> The 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> predicate is useful, and it is important to know how to put it to work. But it is just as important to know that it can be a source of inefficiency, and that you probably don&#8217;t want to use it all the time. 
</p> 
<!--l. 362--> 
<p class="indent"> Why is 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> a source of inefficiency? If you think about the way it works, you&#8217;ll notice a weakness: 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> doesn&#8217;t join two lists in one simple action. Rather, it needs to work its way down its first argument until it finds the end of the list, and only then can it carry out the concatenation. 
</p> 
<!--l. 368--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, often this causes no problems. For example, if we have two lists and we just want to concatenate them, it&#8217;s probably not too bad. Sure, Prolog will need to work down the length of the first list, but if the list is not too long, that&#8217;s probably not too high a price to pay for the ease of working with 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> . 
</p> 
<!--l. 374--> 
<p class="indent"> But matters may be very different if the first two arguments are given as variables. As we&#8217;ve just seen, it can be very useful to give 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> variables in its first two arguments, for this lets Prolog search for ways of splitting up the lists. But there is a price to pay: a lot of searching is going on, and this can lead to very inefficient programs. 
</p> 
<!--l. 381--> 
<p class="indent"> To illustrate this, we shall examine the problem of reversing a list. That is, we will examine the problem of defining a predicate which takes a list (say 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a,b,c,d] 
</span> 
</span> ) as input and returns a list containing the same elements in the reverse order (here 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [d,c,b,a] 
</span> 
</span> ). 
</p> 
<!--l. 387--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, a reverse predicate is a useful predicate to have around. As you will have realised by now, lists in Prolog are far easier to access from the front than from the back. For example, to pull out the head of a list 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> L 
</span> 
</span> , all we have to do is perform the unification 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [H|_] 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;= 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;L 
</span> 
</span> ; this results in 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> H 
</span> 
</span> being instantiated to the head of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> L 
</span> 
</span> . But pulling out the last element of an arbitrary list is harder: we can&#8217;t do it simply using unification. On the other hand, if we had a predicate which reversed lists, we could first reverse the input list, and then pull out the head of the reversed list, as this would give us the last element of the original list. So a reverse predicate could be a useful tool. However, as we may have to reverse large lists, we would like this tool to be efficient. So we need to think about the problem carefully. 
</p> 
<!--l. 401--> 
<p class="indent"> And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going to do now. We will define two reverse predicates: a naive one, defined with the help of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> , and a more efficient (and indeed, more natural) one defined using accumulators.

<!--l. 410--> 
<p class="noindent"> Here&#8217;s a recursive definition of what is involved in reversing a list: 
</p> 
<!--l. 412--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<ol class="enumerate1"> 
<li class="enumerate" id="x41-57002x1"> If we reverse the empty list, we obtain the empty list. 
</li> 
<li class="enumerate" id="x41-57004x2"> If we reverse the list 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [H|T] 
</span> 
</span> , we end up with the list obtained by reversing 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> T 
</span> 
</span> and concatenating with 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [H] 
</span> 
</span> . 
</li> 
</ol> 
<!--l. 418--> 
<p class="noindent"> To see that the recursive clause is correct, consider the list 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a,b,c,d] 
</span> 
</span> . If we reverse the tail of this list we obtain 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [d,c,b] 
</span> 
</span> . Concatenating this with 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a] 
</span> 
</span> yields 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [d,c,b,a] 
</span> 
</span> , which is the reverse of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a,b,c,d] 
</span> 
</span> . 
</p> 
<!--l. 423--> 
<p class="indent"> With the help of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> it is easy to turn this recursive definition into Prolog: 
</p> 
<!--l. 426--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb294"> 
<a id="x41-57006r1">

</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;append(RevT,[H],R). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 431--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, this definition is correct, but it does an awful lot of work. It is 
<span class="cmti-10"> very 
</span> instructive to look at a trace of this program. This shows that the program is spending a lot of time carrying out appends. This shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising: after, all, we are calling 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> recursively. The result is very inefficient (if you run a trace, you will find that it takes about 90 steps to reverse an eight element list) and hard to understand (the predicate spends most of its time in the recursive calls to 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> , making it very hard to see what is going on). 
</p> 
<!--l. 441--> 
<p class="indent"> Not nice. But as we shall now see, there

<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"> 
<a id="x41-580006.2"> 
</a> Reverse using an accumulator 
</h4> 
<!--l. 447--> 
<p class="noindent"> The better way is to use an accumulator. The underlying idea is simple and natural. Our accumulator will be a list, and when we start it will be empty. Suppose we want to reverse 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a,b,c,d] 
</span> 
</span> . At the start, our accumulator will be 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [] 
</span> 
</span> . So we simply take the head of the list we are trying to reverse and add it as the head of the accumulator. We then carry on processing the tail, thus we are faced with the task of reversing 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [b,c,d] 
</span> 
</span> , and our accumulator is 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [a] 
</span> 
</span> . Again we take the head of the list we are trying to reverse and add it as the head of the accumulator (thus our new accumulator is 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [b,a] 
</span> 
</span> ) and carry on trying to reverse 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [c,d] 
</span> 
</span> . Again we use the same idea, so we get a new accumulator 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [c,b,a] 
</span> 
</span> , and try to reverse 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [d] 
</span> 
</span> . Needless to say, the next step yields an accumulator 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [d,c,b,a] 
</span> 
</span> and the new goal of trying to reverse 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> [] 
</span> 
</span> . This is where the process stops: 
<span class="cmti-10"> and our accumulator contains the reversed list we want 
</span> . To summarise: the idea is simply to work our way through the list we want to reverse, and push each element in turn onto the head of the accumulator, like this:

<p class="noindent"> This will be efficient because we simply blast our way through the list once: we don&#8217;t have to waste time carrying out concatenation or other irrelevant work. 
</p> 
<!--l. 476--> 
<p class="indent"> It&#8217;s also easy to put this idea in Prolog. Here&#8217;s the accumulator code: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb296"> 
<a id="x41-58012r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> accRev([H|T],A,R):- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;accRev(T,[H|A],R). 
</span> 
<br class="fancyvrb" /> 
<a id="x41-58014r2"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> accRev([],A,A). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 482--> 
<p class="noindent"> This is classic accumulator code: it follows the same pattern as the arithmetic examples we examined in the previous chapter. The recursive clause is responsible for chopping off the head of the input list, and pushing it onto the accumulator. The base case halts the program, and copies the accumulator to the final argument. 
</p> 
<!--l. 488--> 
<p class="indent"> As is usual with accumulator code, it&#8217;s a good idea to write a predicate which carries out the required initialisation of the accumulator for us: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb297"> 
<a id="x41-58016r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> rev(L,R):- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;accRev(L,[],R). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 495--> 
<p class="indent"> Again, it is instructive to run some traces on this program and compare it with 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> naiverev/2 
</span> 
</span> . The accumulator based version is 
<span class="cmti-10"> clearly 
</span> better. For example, it takes about 20 steps to reverse an eight element list, as opposed to 90 for the naive version. Moreover, the trace is far easier to follow. The idea underlying the accumulator based version is simpler and more natural than the recursive calls to 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> . 
</p> 
<!--l. 504--> 
<p class="indent"> Summing up, 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> append/3 
</span> 
</span> is a useful program, and you certainly should not be scared of using it. However, you also need to be aware that it is a source of inefficiency, so when you use it, ask yourself whether there is a better way. And often there is. The use of accumulators is often better, and (as the 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> rev/2 
</span> 
</span> example show) accumulators can be a natural way of handling list processing tasks.
