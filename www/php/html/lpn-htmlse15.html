</h3> 
<!--l. 468--> 
<p class="noindent"> The 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> predicate works by recursively working its way down a list, doing something to the head, and then recursively doing the same thing to the tail. Recursing down a list (or indeed, several lists) in this way is extremely common in Prolog; so common, in fact, that it is important that you really master the technique. So let&#8217;s look at another example. 
</p> 
<!--l. 475--> 
<p class="indent"> When working with lists, we often want to compare one list with another, or to copy bits of one list into another, or to translate the contents of one list into another, or something similar. Here&#8217;s an example. Let&#8217;s suppose we need a predicate 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> that takes two lists as arguments, and succeeds if the first argument is a list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s, and the second argument is a list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s of exactly the same length. For example, if we pose the following query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb197"> 
<a id="x29-42002r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a,a],[b,b,b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 486--> 
<p class="noindent"> we want Prolog to say yes. On the other hand, if we pose the query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb198"> 
<a id="x29-42004r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a,a],[b,b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 490--> 
<p class="noindent"> or the query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb199"> 
<a id="x29-42006r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,c,a,a],[b,b,5,4]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 494--> 
<p class="noindent"> we want Prolog to say no. 
</p> 
<!--l. 496--> 
<p class="indent"> When faced with such tasks, often the best way to set about solving them is to start by thinking about the simplest possible case. Now, when working with lists, thinking about the simplest case often means thinking about the empty list, and it certainly means this here. After all: what is the shortest possible list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s? It&#8217;s the empty list. Why? Because it contains no 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s at all. And what is the shortest possible list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s? Again, the empty list: no 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s whatsoever in that. So the most basic information our definition needs to contain is 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb200"> 
<a id="x29-42008r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([],[]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 508--> 
<p class="noindent"> This records the obvious fact that the empty list contains exactly as many 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s as 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s. But although obvious, this fact turns out to play an important role in our program, as we shall see. 
</p> 
<!--l. 512--> 
<p class="indent"> So far so good: but how do we proceed? Here&#8217;s the idea: for longer lists, 
<span class="cmti-10"> think 
</span> 
<span class="cmti-10"> recursively 
</span> . So: when should 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> decide that two non-empty lists are a list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s and a list of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s of exactly the same length? Simple: when the head of the first list is an 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> , and the head of the second list is a 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> , and 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> decides that the two tails are lists of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s and 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s of exactly the same length! This immediately gives us the following rule: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb201"> 
<a id="x29-42010r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a|Ta],[b|Tb]) 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;:- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;a2b(Ta,Tb). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 523--> 
<p class="noindent"> This says: the 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> predicate should succeed if its first argument is a list with head 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> , its second argument is a list with head 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> , and 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> succeeds on the two tails. 
</p> 
<!--l. 528--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, this definition make good sense declaratively. It is a simple and natural recursive predicate, the base clause dealing with the empty list, the recursive clause dealing with non-empty lists. But how does it work in practice? That is, what is its procedural meaning? For example, if we pose the query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb202"> 
<a id="x29-42012r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a],[b,b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 536--> 
<p class="noindent"> Prolog will say yes, which is what we want &#8212; but 
<span class="cmti-10"> why 
</span> exactly does this happen? 
</p> 
<!--l. 539--> 
<p class="indent"> Let&#8217;s work the example through. In this query, neither list is empty, so the fact does not help. Thus Prolog goes on to try the recursive rule. Now, the query does match the rule (after all, the head of the first list is 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> and the head of the second is 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> ) so Prolog now has a new goal, namely 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb203"> 
<a id="x29-42014r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a],[b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 547--> 
<p class="noindent"> Once again, the fact does not help with this, but the recursive rule can be used again, leading to the following goal: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb204"> 
<a id="x29-42016r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a],[b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 552--> 
<p class="noindent"> Yet again the fact does not help, but the recursive rule does, so we get the following goal: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb205"> 
<a id="x29-42018r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([],[]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 557--> 
<p class="noindent"> At last we can use the fact: this tells us that, yes, we really do have two lists here that contain exactly the same number of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> s and 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> s (namely, none at all). And because this goal succeeds, this means that the goal 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb206"> 
<a id="x29-42020r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a],[b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 564--> 
<p class="noindent"> succeeds too. This in turn means that the goal 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb207"> 
<a id="x29-42022r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a],[b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 568--> 
<p class="noindent"> succeeds, and thus that the original goal 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb208"> 
<a id="x29-42024r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a],[b,b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 572--> 
<p class="noindent"> is satisfied. 
</p> 
<!--l. 574--> 
<p class="indent"> We could summarise this process as follows. Prolog started with two lists. It peeled the head off each of them, and checked that they were an 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> and a 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> , respectively, as required. It then recursively analysed the tails of both lists. That is, it worked its way down both tails simultaneously, checking that at each stage the tails were headed by an 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a 
</span> 
</span> and a 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> b 
</span> 
</span> . Why did the process stop? Because at each recursive step we had to work with shorter lists (namely the tails of the lists examined at the previous step) and eventually we ended up with empty lists. At this point, our rather trivial looking fact was able to play a vital role: it said yes. This halted the recursion, and ensured that the original query succeeded. 
</p> 
<!--l. 586--> 
<p class="indent"> It&#8217;s is also important to think about what happens with queries that 
<span class="cmti-10"> fail 
</span> . For example, if we pose the query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb209"> 
<a id="x29-42026r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a,a],[b,b,b]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 591--> 
<p class="noindent"> Prolog will correctly say no. Why? because after carrying out the peel-off-the-head-and-recursively-examine-the-tail process three times, it will be left with the query 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb210"> 
<a id="x29-42028r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a],[]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 597--> 
<p class="noindent"> But this goal cannot be satisfied. And if we pose the query

<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb211"> 
<a id="x29-42030r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,c,a,a],[b,b,5,4]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 602--> 
<p class="noindent"> after carrying out the peel-off-the-head-and-recursively-examine-the-tail process once, Prolog will have the goal

<!--l. 608--> 
<p class="noindent"> and again, this cannot be satisfied.

<p class="indent"> Well, that&#8217;s how 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> works in simple cases, but we haven&#8217;t exhausted its possibilities yet. As always with Prolog, it&#8217;s a good idea to investigate what happens when variables as used as input. And with 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> something interesting happens: it acts as a translator, translating lists of

</span> s to lists of 
<span class="verb">

<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b([a,a,a,a],X).

</span> is an extremely simple example of a program that works by recursing its way down a pair of lists. But don&#8217;t be fooled by its simplicity: the kind of programming it illustrates is fundamental to Prolog. Both its declarative form (a base clause dealing with the empty list, a recursive clause dealing with non-empty lists) and the procedural idea it trades on (do something to the heads, and then recursively do the same thing to the tails) come up again and again in Prolog programming. In fact, in the course of your Prolog career, you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ll write what is essentially the 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> a2b/2 
</span> 
</span> predicate, or a more complex variant of it, many times over in many different guises.
