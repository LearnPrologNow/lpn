<!--l. 280--> 
<p class="noindent"> It&#8217;s time to look at our first example of a recursive Prolog program for manipulating lists. One of the most basic things we would like to know is whether something is an element of a list or not. So let&#8217;s write a program that, when given as inputs an arbitrary object 
<span class="cmti-10"> X 
</span> and a list 
<span class="cmti-10"> L 
</span> , tells us whether or not 
<span class="cmti-10"> X 
</span> belongs to 
<span class="cmti-10"> L 
</span> . The program that does this is usually called member 
<a id="dx28-41001"> 
</a> , and it is the simplest example of a Prolog program that exploits the recursive structure of lists. Here it is: 
</p> 
<!--l. 292--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb185"> 
<a id="x28-41003r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(X,[X|T]). 
</span> 
<br class="fancyvrb" /> 
<a id="x28-41005r2"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(X,[H|T]) 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;:- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;member(X,T). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 298--> 
<p class="indent"> That&#8217;s all there is to it: one fact (namely 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(X,[X|T]) 
</span> 
</span> ) and one rule (namely 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(X,[H|T]) 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;:- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;member(X,T) 
</span> 
</span> ). But note that the rule is recursive (after all, the functor 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member 
</span> 
</span> occurs in both the rule&#8217;s head and body) and it is this that explains why such a short program is all that is required. Let&#8217;s take a closer look. 
</p> 
<!--l. 305--> 
<p class="indent"> We&#8217;ll start by reading the program declaratively. And read this way, it is obviously sensible. The first clause (the fact) simply says: an object 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> X 
</span> 
</span> is a member of a list if it is the head of that list. Note that we used the built-in 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> | 
</span> 
</span> operator to state this (simple but important) principle about lists. 
</p> 
<!--l. 311--> 
<p class="indent"> What about the second clause, the recursive rule? This says: an object 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> X 
</span> 
</span> is member of a list if it is a member of the tail of the list. Again, note that we used the 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> | 
</span> 
</span> operator to state this principle. 
</p> 
<!--l. 316--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, clearly this definition makes good declarative sense. But does this program actually 
<span class="cmti-10"> do 
</span> what it is supposed to do? That is, will it really tell us whether an object 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> X 
</span> 
</span> belongs to a list 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> L 
</span> 
</span> ? And if so, how exactly does it do this? To answer such questions, we need to think about its procedural meaning. Let&#8217;s work our way through a few examples. 
</p> 
<!--l. 323--> 
<p class="indent"> Suppose we posed the following query: 
</p> 
<!--l. 325--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb186"> 
<a id="x28-41007r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> ?- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;member(yolanda,[yolanda,trudy,vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 328--> 
<p class="noindent"> Prolog will immediately answer yes. Why? Because it can unify 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> yolanda 
</span> 
</span> with both occurrences of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> X 
</span> 
</span> in the first clause (the fact) in the definition of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> , so it succeeds immediately. 
</p> 
<!--l. 333--> 
<p class="indent"> Next consider the following query: 
</p> 
<!--l. 335--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb187"> 
<a id="x28-41009r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> ?- 
</span> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> &#x00A0;member(vincent,[yolanda,trudy,vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 338--> 
<p class="noindent"> Now the first rule won&#8217;t help ( 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> vincent 
</span> 
</span> and 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> yolanda 
</span> 
</span> are distinct atoms) so Prolog goes to the second clause, the recursive rule. This gives Prolog a new goal: it now has to see if 
</p> 
<!--l. 342--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb188"> 
<a id="x28-41011r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(vincent,[trudy,vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 345--> 
<p class="noindent"> Once again the first clause won&#8217;t help, so Prolog goes (again) to the recursive rule. This gives it a new goal, namely

</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(vincent,[vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 351--> 
<p class="noindent"> This time, the first clause does help, and the query succeeds. 
</p> 
<!--l. 353--> 
<p class="indent"> So far so good, but we need to ask an important question. What happens when we pose a query that 
<span class="cmti-10"> fails 
</span> ? For example, what happens if we pose the query 
</p> 
<!--l. 357--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb190"> 
<a id="x28-41015r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(zed,[yolanda,trudy,vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 362--> 
<p class="indent"> Now, this should obviously fail (after all, 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> zed 
</span> 
</span> is not on the list). So how does Prolog handle this? In particular, how can we be sure that Prolog really will 
<span class="cmti-10"> stop 
</span> , and say 
<span class="cmti-10"> no 
</span> , instead going into an endless recursive loop? 
</p> 
<!--l. 367--> 
<p class="indent"> Let&#8217;s think this through systematically. Once again, the first clause cannot help, so Prolog uses the recursive rule, which gives it a new goal 
</p> 
<!--l. 371--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb191">

</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(zed,[trudy,vincent,jules]). 
</span>

<!--l. 374--> 
<p class="noindent"> Again, the first clause doesn&#8217;t help, so Prolog reuses the recursive rule and tries to show that

<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb192"> 
<a id="x28-41019r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(zed,[vincent,jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 380--> 
<p class="noindent"> Similarly, the first rule doesn&#8217;t help, so Prolog reuses the second rule yet again and tries the goal 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb193"> 
<a id="x28-41021r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(zed,[jules]). 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 386--> 
<p class="noindent"> Again the first clause doesn&#8217;t help, so Prolog uses the second rule, which gives it the goal 
</p> 
<!--l. 389--> 
<p class="indent"> 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb194"> 
<a id="x28-41023r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(zed,[]) 
</span> 
</div> 
<!--l. 392--> 
<p class="noindent"> And 
<span class="cmti-10"> this 
</span> is where things get interesting. Obviously the first clause can&#8217;t help here. But note: 
<span class="cmti-10"> the recursive rule can&#8217;t do anything more either 
</span> . Why not? Simple: the recursive rule relies on splitting the list into a head and a tail, but as we have already seen, the empty list 
<span class="cmti-10"> can&#8217;t 
</span> be split up in this way. So the recursive rule cannot be applied either, and Prolog stops searching for more solutions and announces no. That is, it tells us that 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> zed 
</span> 
</span> does not belong to the list, which is just what it ought to do. 
</p> 
<!--l. 402--> 
<p class="indent"> We could summarise the 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> predicate as follows. It is a recursive predicate, which systematically searches down the length of the list for the required item. It does this by stepwise breaking down the list into smaller lists, and looking at the first item of each smaller list. This mechanism that drives this search is recursion, and the reason that this recursion is safe (that is, the reason it does not go on forever) is that at the end of the line Prolog has to ask a question about the empty list. The empty list 
<span class="cmti-10"> cannot 
</span> be broken down into smaller parts, and this allows a way out of the recursion. 
</p> 
<!--l. 413--> 
<p class="indent"> Well, we&#8217;ve now seen why 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> works, but in fact it&#8217;s far more useful than the previous example might suggest. Up till now we&#8217;ve only been using it to answer yes/no questions. But we can also pose questions containing variables. For example, we can have the following dialog with Prolog:

<p class="indent"> That is, Prolog has told us what every member of a list is. This is an extremely common use of 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> . In effect, by using the variable we are saying to Prolog: &#8220;Quick! Give me some element of the list!&#8221;. In many applications we need to be able to extract members of a list, and this is the way it is typically done. 
</p> 
<!--l. 443--> 
<p class="indent"> One final remark. The way we defined 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> above is certainly correct, but in one respect it is a little messy. 
</p> 
<!--l. 446--> 
<p class="indent"> Think about it. The first clause is there to deal with the head of the list. But although the tail is irrelevant to the first clause, we named the tail using the variable 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> T 
</span> 
</span> . Similarly, the recursive rule is there to deal with the tail of the list. But although the head is irrelevant here, we named it using the variable 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> H 
</span> 
</span> . These unnecessary variable names are distracting: it&#8217;s better to write predicates in a way that focuses attention on what is really important in each clause, and the anonymous variable gives us a nice way of doing this. That is, we can rewrite 
<span class="verb"> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member/2 
</span> 
</span> as follows: 
</p> 
<div class="fancyvrb" id="fancyvrb196"> 
<a id="x28-41047r1"> 
</a> 
<span class="cmtt-10"> member(X,[X|_]).
