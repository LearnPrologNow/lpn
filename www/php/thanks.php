<h1>Thank you!</h1>

<p>
Over the years, a lot of people have contributed to Learn Prolog Now!
in one way or another:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Gertjan van Noord and Robbert Prins used early versions of LPN! in
their teaching at the University of Groningen. They gave us detailed
feedback which really helped us improve the accuracy of the text.
</li>
<li>
Malvina Nissim supplied us with an upgrade of
Exercise 2.4 and gave us a lot of help and advice regarding the final
hardcopy version.
</li>
<li>
Dov Gabbay founded College Publications and thereby made it possible
for us to publish LPN! on paper as well as online. And thanks to
Vincent Hendricks for telling us about it.
</li>
<li>
Jane Spurr, the managing director of College publications gave us lots of time
and attention in the final run-up to publication. She was always there
for us and reacted promptly to the invariable last minute
problems. Thank you Jane.
</li>
<li>
Jan Wielemaker made SWI Prolog freely available
over the internet and gave us speedy and informative feedback  on a number of
technical issues.
</li>
<li>
Ian Mackie and an anonymous
referee put a lot of time and energy into the penultimate version
of the (printed) book.
</li>
<li>Bart Demoen wrote a very thorough review of our book for the
journal "Theory and Practice of Logic Programming", which brought up
many good points that will help us improve LPN! for the next edition.
</li>
<li>
Peter Urbak, Richard Kenyon, Matt Braithwaite, Anas Elghafari, Shannon "JJ" Behrens, Alejandro Mar&iacute;n Buritic&aacute;, Gabriele Medeot, Danny Rademacher, Ali Almiman
sent us useful corrections that are incorporated in the free online version!
