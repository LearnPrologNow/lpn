<h1>Errata of the first printing</h1>

<p>
This is a list of errata for the first printing of the handheld
version of 'Learn Prolog Now!'.  If you find any mistakes that are not
listed here, yet, <a href="lpnpage.php?pageid=contact">please let us know.</a>
</p>
<p>
The mistakes in this list have been corrected in the second printing.

<dd><span class="code">accLen3/</span> should be <span class="code">accLen/3</span>.</dd>

<dt>p. 169</dt>
<dd><span class="code">novar</span> should be <span class="code">nonvar</span>.</dd>

<dt>p. 115, p.116</dt>
<dd><span class="code">reverse/2</span> should be <span class="code">rev/2</span>.
Actually, in SWI Prolog <span class="code">reverse/2</span> is a built-in
predicate which does what <span class="code">rev/2</span> does, namely reverse
a list. So, if you are using SWI Prolog, you can write 
<span class="code">reverse/2</span> instead of <span class="code">rev/2</span>.</dd>

<dt>pp. 119-137, Chapter 7</dt>
<dd>In this chapter, we sometimes refer to "extra goals" and sometimes to 
"extra test". That's the same thing.</dd>

<dt>p. 136</dt>
<dd>In the middle of the page, under number 2, it should be: <i>and the b and c 
blocks are also exactly the same length and furthermore consist of an even number 
of bs and cs</i>.
</dd>

<dt>p. 156</dt>
<dd>The last rule of the DCG should be <span class="code">v --> [eats]</span>.</dd>


<dt>p. 236, Answer 1.3</dt>
<dd>The goals in this knowledge base are: <span class="code">man(X), woman(X), father(X,Y), 
man(Y), son(Z,Y), daughter(Z,Y). knows(Y,X)</span> is not a goal. (It's
not even mentioned in the knowledge base.)</dd>

<dt>p. 240</dt>
<dd>There is one occurrence of <span class="code">criminal</span> in single 
quotes. It should be without quotes.</dd>

<dt>p. 246, Answer 6.2</dt>
<dd>This answer uses the predicate <span class="code">reverse/2</span>
which is built-in in SWI Prolog. If you are using some other version of
Prolog, you should use <span class="code">rev/2</span> as defined in 
Chapter 6 instead.
</dd>

<dt>p. 248, Answer 7.1</dt>
<dd>In the last line of the internal representation of the DCG, there
is a goal <span class="code">wriggle(C,B)</span>. It should be
<span class="code">wiggle(C,B)</span>.</dd>

<dt>p. 248, Answer 8.1</dt>
<dd>The NP-rule should be 
<span class="code">np(Num) --> det(Num), n(Num)</span>. And the determiner
rules should be <span class="code">det(_) --> [the]</span> and 
<span class="code">det(sg) --> [a]</span>.</dd>
